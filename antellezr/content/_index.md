Hello! I’m Angel, a technical writer and _connector of dots_ who loves turning scattered ideas into clear and practical documentation.

My experience as a technical writer, combined with my background in IT and service management, has given me a unique perspective on how information flows across different teams and industries. Working on projects in media, news, publishing, retail, and consulting has further shaped my ability to craft user-friendly documentation that truly makes an impact.

I specialize in analyzing complex processes, finding opportunities for improvement, and weaving it all into a cohesive solution. Whether I’m creating style guides and training materials or supporting digital transformation efforts, I stay focused on what readers actually need.

I’ve been recognized for blending deep technical knowledge with strategic thinking, offering insights that guide documentation direction, strengthen team dynamics, and spark new ideas. With a natural leadership style and a proactive approach, I enjoy building strong partnerships across teams to keep projects moving forward.

I’m here to simplify the complex so people can work better, faster, and with greater confidence.

## Projects

### Media & Publishing Industry

Contributed to improving API documentation and migrating content to a new developer portal while minimizing disruptions.

- **API Documentation Audit**: Audited API documentation and contributed to an improved API specification workflow.
- **Docs-as-Code Migration**: Contributed to the migration of documentation to a new developer portal, ensuring seamless accessibility for users.
- **AI-Driven Scripting**: Automated two critical tasks:
  - **Link Updates**: Automated the process of scanning and updating outdated image links in Markdown files.
  - **URL Redirects**: Converted and redirected legacy URLs, restoring 86% of broken links and proposing likely matches for the remaining cases.

This approach reduced manual effort, sped up the migration, and ensured customers and internal teams quickly regained seamless access to essential documentation.

### News Media Industry

As part of a large-scale CMS migration, I created comprehensive technical documentation to support backend, frontend, and QA teams.

- **Backend Migration Documentation**: Outlined every stage of the migration process—from initial discovery and architecture design to development and launch—providing teams with a clear roadmap for similar projects.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Developed guides on WebSocket events and AWS Lambda functions, helping developers transition to the new event model.
- **QA Automation Framework**: Developed detailed documentation for a Playwright/TypeScript testing solution, enabling end-to-end testing and CI/CD integration.
- **User Access and Paywall Management**: Documented subscription tiers and paywall structures to ensure consistent experiences across platforms.

This documentation empowered cross-functional teams to adopt new technologies efficiently and ensured a smoother transition.

### Consulting & Accounting Industry

Improved API documentation consistency and introduced automation to streamline content creation.

- **API Documentation Standardization**: Unified structure and terminology across multiple products, improving clarity.
- **Markdown-to-HTML Automation**: Developed a semi-automated process to convert Markdown tables to HTML, reducing documentation time by 66%.
- **AI/ML Tool Documentation POC**: Created a structured proof-of-concept for documenting an AI/ML-based tool, emphasizing how documentation can scale alongside development.

These initiatives enhanced documentation efficiency and reduced manual effort across teams.

### Media & Entertainment Industry

Developed process-oriented documentation and operational guides to improve workflows across design, QA, and engineering teams.

- **Operational Runbooks**: Created process documentation, templates, and guides for various teams.
- **Self-Guided Onboarding**: Designed an onboarding framework that reduced ramp-up time by 50%.
- **Incident Management**: Introduced post-mortem templates and a Known-Error knowledge base to improve incident resolution.

These efforts streamlined onboarding, reduced response times, and improved knowledge sharing.

### Retail Industry

Led documentation efforts to improve internal processes.

- **IT Infrastructure Documentation**: Developed guides covering architecture, DevOps, CI/CD, and software engineering best practices.
- **Internal Style Guide and Templates**: Standardized documentation practices across multiple teams, leading to widespread adoption among the company.
- **Technical Writing Training**: Facilitated best practices training for internal business analysts, enhancing documentation quality.
- **Centralized Documentation Hub**: Developed a structured knowledge base to organize and display technical content effectively.

By implementing structured documentation and training, I improved team efficiency and knowledge sharing across the organization.

### Internal Initiatives

Beyond project-based work, I have contributed to initiatives that enhance technical writing culture and onboarding processes.

- **TW Buddy Program**: Launched a peer-support initiative to help new team members integrate smoothly.
- **Onboarding Documentation**: Consolidated essential information into a Quick-Start Guide, reducing information overload for new hires.

These initiatives promoted a stronger technical writing community and improved onboarding experiences.
